        <h2>What is Domestic Abuse?</h2>
        <p>
          Domestic violence which can also be referred as intimate partner violence (IPV), domestic abuse or relationship abuse, is a pattern of behaviors 
          used by one partner in an intimate relationship or 
          marriage to dominate and control the other. Domestic violence and abuse are used for one purpose and one purpose only and that is to <strong>gain</strong> and <strong>maintain</strong> total control over you. 
          An abuser does not think of “playing fair.” An abuser uses fear, guilt, shame, manipulation and intimidation to wear you down and keep you under their thumb.
<br>
          Domestic violence is no respecter of anyone. It can happen to anybody irregardless of your race, age, sexual orientation, religion or gender. It can happen to people who are married, living together 
          or who are dating. And while women are more often victimized, men also experience abuse in other ways too including verbal and emotional abuse. The bottom line is that abusive behavior is never acceptable, whether from a man, woman, 
          teenager, or an older adult. Every deserves to feel <strong>valued, respected, and safe. </strong>
         </p>
      </div>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-10" id="main-content">
      <p>
        Domestic abuse often escalates from threats, then to verbal assault and lastly to violence. Although physical injury may pose as a more obvious danger, the emotional and psychological 
        consequences of domestic abuse are also severe. Emotionally abusive relationships can lead to many devastating implications in the future. It can result destroying self-worth, 
        may lead to anxiety and depression, make you feel helpless 
        and alone. No one should have to endure this kind of pain—and your first step to breaking free is recognizing that your relationship is abusive.

        <h2>Emotional Abuse - The Silent Widow</h2>
        <p>
            The aim of emotional abuse is to chip away at your feelings of self-worth and independence—leaving you feeling that there’s no way out of the relationship, or that without your abusive partner, you have nothing.
<br>
            Abusers who use emotional or psychological abuse often throw in threats of physical violence or other repercussions if you don’t do as they want.
<br>
              Emotional abuse includes verbal abuse such as yelling, name-calling, blaming, and shaming. Isolation, intimidation, and controlling behavior are also forms of emotional abuse.

              <br>
              
              The scars of emotional abuse are very real and they run deep. You may think that physical abuse is far worse than emotional abuse, since physical violence can send you to the hospital and leave you with physical wounds. But emotional abuse can be just as damaging—sometimes even more so.

              Domestic violence and abuse does not take place because of an abuser loses control over their behavior. In fact, abusive behavior and violence is a deliberate choice to gain control. Perpetrators use a variety of tactics to manipulate you and exert their power, including:
<br>
<br>
              <strong>Dominance</strong> – Abusive individuals need to feel in charge of the relationship. They may make decisions for you and the family, tell you what to do, and expect you to obey without question. Your abuser may treat you like a servant, child, or even as their possession.
<br>
<br>
              <strong>Humiliation</strong> – An abuser will do everything they can to lower your self-esteem or make you feel defective in some way. After all, if you believe you’re worthless and that no one else will want you, you’re less likely to leave. Insults, name-calling, shaming, and public put-downs are all weapons of abuse designed to erode your self-worth and make you feel powerless.
<br>
<br>
              <strong>Isolation </strong>– In order to increase your dependence on them, an abusive partner will cut you off from the outside world. They may keep you from seeing family or friends, or even prevent you from going to work or school. You may have to ask permission to do anything, go anywhere, or see anyone.
<br>
<br>
              <strong>Threats</strong> – Abusers commonly use threats to keep their partners from leaving or scare them into dropping charges. Your abuser may threaten to hurt or kill you, your children, other family members, or even pets. They may also threaten to commit suicide, file false charges against you, or report you to child services.
<br>
<br>
              <strong>Intimidation</strong> – Your abuser may use a variety of intimidation tactics designed to scare you into submission. Such tactics include making threatening looks or gestures, smashing things in front of you, destroying property, hurting your pets, or putting weapons on display. The message behind these actions is that violent violent consequences will follow if you don’t obey.
<br>
<br>
             <strong>Denial and blame </strong> – Abusers are adept at making excuses for the inexcusable. They may blame their abusive and violent behavior on a bad childhood, a bad day, or even on you and the kids, the victims of their abuse. They may minimize the abuse or deny that it occurred. Often, they will shift the responsibility on to you: somehow, their violent and abusive behavior is your fault.
